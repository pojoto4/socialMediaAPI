## Installation

You need to npm i to install everything in the package.json and then you can build it, seed it and then open up the server in Insomnia.

## Usage

Once you get it running in Insomnia, you can test different routes to see all users or single users, create users, update users and delete users. For each user, you can add friends and delete friends. Each user has thoughts associated with them, so you can see all thoughts or single thoughts. Then you can create thoughts, update thoughts and delete thoughts. Thoughts can have reactions, so you can add reactions using the thoughtid and delete the reaction using the reaction id.

## Contributing

This was built from a template provided in the develop folder.
